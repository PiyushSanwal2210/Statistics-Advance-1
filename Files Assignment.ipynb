    "In probability theory, a random variable is a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon.

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Z-scores indicate the relative position of a data point within its distribution. A positive z-score indicates a value above the mean, while a negative z-score indicates a value below the mean.

    "Imagine comparing the test scores of two students who took different exams with different average scores and standard deviations. By converting their scores to z-scores, you can see who performed better relative to their respective class. For example, if one student has a z-score of 1.5 and the other has a z-score of 1.0, the student with the z-score of 1.5 performed better relative to their class, even if their raw scores were different. \n",

    "Ans = The Magical Concept of Expected Value | by Matthew Gliatto ...The expected value in a probability distribution represents the long-run average outcome of a random variable. It's a weighted average of all possible values, where each value is weighted by its corresponding probability. Essentially, it tells you what you can \"expect\" to happen on average if you repeat an experiment many times. \n",

    "A probability distribution describes the likelihood of each possible outcome of a random variable. \n",

    "A random variable is a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon. \n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Value (E(X)):\n",
    "\n",
    "For a discrete random variable, the expected value is calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and summing the results. The formula is: E(X) = Σ [x * P(x)], where 'x' represents each outcome and 'P(x)' its probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting Expected Value:\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected value is not necessarily a value that will be observed in any single trial of the experiment. Instead, it represents the average outcome over many repetitions. If you were to repeatedly run the experiment, the average of the outcomes would tend towards the expected value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Imagine flipping a fair coin. The possible outcomes are heads (H) and tails (T), each with a probability of 0.5. The expected value of the number of heads in a single flip is (1 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 0.5. This means that, on average, you would expect to get half a head (which is, of course, impossible in a single flip) if you flipped the coin many times. \n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the expected value provides a way to quantify the central tendency or average outcome of a probability distribution, helping in decision-making and understanding the long-term behavior of random events. \n"

    "Ans = A probability distribution describes the likelihood of different outcomes for a random variable, and the expected outcome (or expected value) is a weighted average of those outcomes, where the weights are their respective probabilities.

    "The expected value (often denoted E[X] or μ) represents the long-run average outcome of a random variable. For a discrete random variable, it's calculated by summing the product of each outcome and its probability. For a continuous random variable, it involves an integral. \n",

It tells you the likelihood of each outcome, which is then used in the calculation of the weighted average (expected value). Essentially, the expected value is a summary statistic that captures the central tendency of the probability distribution. \n"
